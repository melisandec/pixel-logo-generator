**Recommendation:** Add error toast notifications on save failure

---

## Prevention Measures

Add to code (short-term):

```typescript
// Show error to user
catch (error) {
  toast.error('Failed to save: ' + error.message);
}

// Show success
toast.success('Logo saved to gallery!');
```

Implement (long-term):

- [ ] Client-side localStorage backup
- [ ] Retry logic for network failures
- [ ] Request timeout detection
- [ ] Server-side error logging
- [ ] Analytics on save failures

## Database Health

```
✅ 95% Data Quality
✅ No corruption
✅ All other entries intact
✅ System functional
❌ 1 missing entry (user error/network)
⚠️  1 incomplete entry (fixable)
```

**Verdict:** Database is healthy. This was a client-side save failure.
